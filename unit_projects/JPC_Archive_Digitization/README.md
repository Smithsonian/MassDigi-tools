# JPC Archive Digitization

DPO is working with other Smithsonian Units and the Getty to digitize the [Johnson Publishing Company Archive](https://nmaahc.si.edu/about/news/ford-mellon-and-macarthur-foundations-transfer-sole-ownership-historic-ebony-and-jet), which features >4 million prints and negatives, including Ebony and Jet.

This repo contains the scripts used to gather, integrate, and migrate data and identifiers. 

### Current Status: Pilot Test

The project is in testing phase of the Pilot images and the code will change while we test the best approaches and workflows.
